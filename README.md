# kapoera

A small (~40kb) CSS framework similar to [Tachyons](https://tachyons.io).

## Installation

Grab a CSS file from http://unpkg.com/kapoera. There's two varieties of Kapoera
distributed, standard and minimal. Standard includes everything and weighs in at
about 40kb, while minimal excludes fancy features like Flexbox and CSS Grid,
which makes it weigh about 30kb.

You can also install Kapoera over `npm`:

```
npm install kapoera
```
